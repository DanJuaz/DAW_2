Hello everyone and welcome to this beginner-friendly tutorial

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.690
on creating your first hello world web page using HTML and CSS.

3
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.290
I'm Sam and let's Dive Right In!

4
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.890
the editor we are going to use is the famous

5
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.990
Visual Studio code and an extension called live preview.

6
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.990
First we create the necessary files to begin with which are "index.HTML" and "styles.CSS".

7
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.890
Visual Studio code helps us creating the

8
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.890
structure for a valid "HTML" file by writing an!

9
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.190
We have to make a link between the 'html' file and the "CSS" file by using the tag name "link".

10
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.990
Then we create the most important heading "H1" with a content of "Hello World".

11
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.090
By using the "live preview" extention we can access

12
00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.190
to the page from our browser by a generated local link.

13
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.590
In the "CSS" file, I am going to add

14
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.690
some styles to the first heading we created in the "HTML" file.

15
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.690
We can change the color of the text or the background color.

16
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.390
Change the Border radius.

17
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.190
Change the horizontal alignment of the text.

18
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.990
Create a border.

19
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.190
And congratulations! You've just created your very first webpage using HTML and CSS.
